# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is an optimization method based on the principle of optimality, where an optimal policy consists of optimal subpolicies.

## Memoization Recipe

### 1. Make it work

- Implement the tree using recursion.
- Test it.

### 2. Make it efficient
- Add a memo object.
- Add a base case to return memoized values.
- Store return values into the memo.
